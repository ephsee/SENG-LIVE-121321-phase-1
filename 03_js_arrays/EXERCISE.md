There are some questions commented out above the function within the starter code that will affect some of what you do for this one. Primarily, your approach will change depending on whether you decide to delete the task from the existing todoList or just return a new todoList without the task included.

The `removeTask` function should:
- accept the `todoList` and a `taskId` as parameters.
- return a `todoList` that no longer includes the task object whose `id` property matches the value passed as an argument for the `taskId` parameter.
